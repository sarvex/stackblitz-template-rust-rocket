# Conclusion

We hope you agree that Rocket is a refreshing take on web frameworks. As with
any software project, Rocket is _alive_. There are always things to improve, and
we're happy to take the best ideas. If you have something in mind, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues).

## Getting Help

If you find yourself having trouble developing Rocket applications, you can get
help via the `#rocket` IRC channel on the [Mozilla IRC
Server](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) at `irc.mozilla.org` and the bridged
[Rocket room on Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mozilla_#rocket:matrix.org).
If you're not familiar with IRC, we recommend chatting through [Matrix via
Riot](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#mozilla_#rocket:matrix.org) or via the [Kiwi
web IRC client](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.mozilla.org/#rocket). You can
learn more about IRC via Mozilla's [Getting Started with
IRC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Getting_Started_with_IRC)
guide.

## What's next?

The best way to learn Rocket is to _build something_. It should be fun and easy,
and there's always someone to help. Alternatively, you can read through the
[Rocket examples](@example) or the [Rocket source code](@github/lib/src).
Whatever you decide to do next, we hope you have a blast!
